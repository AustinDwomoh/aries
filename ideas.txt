now add a system that operates this way
1 when clan tournamnets are made  the creators can set wheter the change in players is dynamic or fixed from the beginning
Dynamic means clans can change players any time and fixed means they have to use stick to those players all through out
allow the tournamnets to chnage between dynamic and fixed for half season changes
 


✅ 4. Clubs Log In Like Users
Easiest way: treat each club as a user (1-to-1):

Add a OneToOneField from Clans to User

Or, use groups/permissions to separate "club" users from regular users

python
Copy
Edit
class Clans(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
Then you can use Django's built-in auth and login for them.

✅ 5. Track Organizers Without New Model
You don’t need a model—use permissions or a boolean field on User:

python
Copy
Edit
# Option A: Boolean field
User.add_to_class('is_organizer', models.BooleanField(default=False))

# Option B: Use Django groups
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
organizers_group = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Organizers')
user.groups.add(organizers_group)
Then in views:

python
Copy
Edit
if request.user.is_organizer:
    # allow special access
Or with groups:

python
Copy
Edit
if request.user.groups.filter(name='Organizers').exists():
    # allow access
Want me to help scaffold this out with actual views/forms/templates too?
